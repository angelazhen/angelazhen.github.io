    <h3>Overview</h3>
    
<p> Today's world, meanings circulate visually in addition to orally and textually. From the renaissance onwards, visuality has become one of the key modes through which to construct knowledge and transmits culture. This is because visual codes around spectatorship where all the participants become a translator and decoder of the original work.</p>
<h3>Male Gaze</h3> 
<p>It's easy for filmmakers to reinforce the male gaze and construct woman as an object because in  many cases, women's physical appearance and place within the composition are altered in ways that transform them from human beings into the objects of desire. To paraphrase Berger, these paintings were not only made to be looked at, but owned.</p>
