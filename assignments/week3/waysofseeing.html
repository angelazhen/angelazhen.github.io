    <h3>Redistribution of Art</h3>
    
<p> Today's world, meanings circulate visually in addition to orally and textually. From the renaissance onwards, visuality has become one of the key modes through which to construct knowledge and transmits culture. This is because visual codes around spectatorship where all the participants become a translator and decoder of the original work.</p>
<h3>Male Gaze</h3> 
<p>It's easy for filmmakers to reinforce the male gaze and construct woman as an object because in  many cases, women's physical appearance and place within the composition are altered in ways that transform them from human beings into the objects of desire. To paraphrase Berger, these paintings were not only made to be looked at, but owned.</p>
<h3>Spectatorship</h3>
<p>Artists relentlessly remind us that the connection between what we see and what we think we know is never that simple, and that seeing is, at its core, a political act. The appearance of a painting was not governed by the Platonic form that artists attempted to emulate, but the social and political climate of the times they lived in, not to mention their religion, race, gender, and class.</p>
<h3>The Wealthy's Perspective</h3>
<p>The invention of the camera completely changed our sense of perspective because now we can see things in places our eyes have never traveled to. It has changed the context with which we view art because we can now see a painting or piece of art in a different setting from the artist intended setting, thus giving us a different perspective of the art. Before the camera was invented you could only see a piece of art in 1 place. The invention of the camera allows us to remove the art and see it in our normal life settings.</p>
