    <a href="#"><span class="hovertext" data-hover="‚ÄúPhotographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are‚Äù(Sontag). We all have our own ways of seeing and interpreting images which are affected by our biases formed based on culture, education, experience, even internet presence. In the recent generation where everyone has a mobile phone and social media, we spend a significant portion of our living, breathing time viewing online content. Especially as Gen Z who takes in all the information from online without questioning its credibility, many of our images and perceptions of the world are skewed. This example best demonstrates how photographs of today is similar to the images on the wall in Plato‚Äôs allegory thousand years ago.">Angela's Bias</span></a>

    <a href="#"><span class="hovertext" data-hover="In today's world, it would be comprehensible to state that the 'shadows on the wall' are photographs. Photographs are used as evidence in courts of law, but how can something so objective as a photograph be mostly subjective? The photograph itself will never change, but the image reveals much about the photographer and the viewer. The image brings viewers into the photographer's eye, seeing what they might deem interesting, capturing something differently than one may imagine. On the contrary, how the viewer absorbs and traverses the image reveals much about their preconceptions and biases.">Kai's Bias</span></a>
